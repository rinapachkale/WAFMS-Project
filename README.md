# Wide Area Frequency Measurement System (WAFMS) #

## Web Development ##

The web development section of the wide-area frequency measurement project is focused on building an efficient and user-friendly application to monitor and analyze frequency measurements across different locations. 

### This section will encompass three key components:  ###
- Frontend development using ReactJS
- Backend development using Node.js
- Database creation using MySQL

The frontend section will involve creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces to visualize real-time frequency data and location-based insights. In the backend section, we will establish a robust Node.js server to handle data requests, process business logic, and interact with the MySQL database. Throughout the development process, we will follow steps including project setup, designing and implementing the frontend, defining the database schema, establishing database connectivity, implementing API endpoints for data retrieval and updates, error handling, testing, and finally, deploying the application to ensure a seamless user experience and accurate frequency measurement analysis.

### Software tools required ###

### MySQL Workbench download ###

To download the latest version of MySQL workbench click <u>[here](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)</u> 
Downloads --> MySQL Community (GPA) Downloads -->  MySQL Installer for Windows --> **mysql-installer-community-8.0.34.0.msi** (version may vary, and do not download mysql-installer-web-community-8.0.34.0.msi instead of mentioned above .msi file)
For the download tutorial, refer to this <u>[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK4nTHqbcMg)</u>. Once you download it successfully open the command prompt and run the command **mysql --version** to ensure successful installation of MySQL workbench, it will show version of MySQL.

## Database (MySQL) ##

## Backend (Node.js) ##

## Frontend (React.js) ##
To create a new React app, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have Node.js (which includes npm, the Node Package Manager) installed on your computer.
2. **Create a New React App:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands in same order to create a new React app using Create React App (a popular tool to set up a new React project):

Firstly, check <u> [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) </u> wesite for the latest version of the global command for Create React App

**`npm i -g create-react-app@1.5.2`** 

It should give results like below:

Then,

**` create-react-app my-react-app `**

It should give results like below:

![Image1](https://github.com/rinapachkale/WAFMS-Project-Blueprint/blob/master/my-react-app.png)

Replace my-react-app with the desired name of your project. This command will generate a new folder with the project structure and necessary files and this might take some time.
